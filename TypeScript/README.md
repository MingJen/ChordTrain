### what we expect for the answer?
- Turn bad code to good code. Do it with all things you care about for writing a good enough code.
- Keep the application in the same functionality. i.e. execute `yarn start` to see the given result.
- You may want to setup a testing environment (e.g. jest, mocha) for helping you to do the refactoring.
- Break every step you take into different commits brief explanations.
